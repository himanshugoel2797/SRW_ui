A Python RPC server module enables deploying copies of this code to remote systems to run commands there, with helpers for file access.
A Python Git module supports version management of simulations.
A 'visualizer' base class provides the ability for scripts to register to the toolset and provide their UI.
The 'srw_tools.py' script serves as the entry point.
